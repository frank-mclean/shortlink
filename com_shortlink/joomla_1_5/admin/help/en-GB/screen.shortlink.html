	<a id="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
	<p>
	Shortlink is an extension to ease link exchange.
	<br />
	When exchanging links you often like to tell other people so called deep links, 
	which directly lead to a concrete article or a specific sub site of a bigger homepage.
	These deep links are hard to remember because they are too long or too much made of
	parameters for the webserver or the content management system like Joomla!.
	</p>
	<p>
	Joomla! lacks of an easy way to shorten links. You may use search engine optimized (SEO)
	links which are much better to read or to remember. But to use that option you need
	server side support in your webserver, you need know how to configure and last but
	not least links still remain quite long. Apart from that many links change. Content is moved
	or removed so that deep links can lead to an error page or, even worse, to a wrong article. 	
	</p>
	<p>
	You need a solution to manage your links and to exchange them to your clients. You want your clients
	to remember the link so that they don't have to find the right link in there notes or in your index.
	You want them to find what they need with less input or clicks. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Shortlink is a component to manage your important links. It lets you create short phrases or keywords
	you can spread to your clients. They only need to remember that keyword and a little bit more if they directly
	want to reach the target. They may also use the according module which helps them finding your article
	even without knowing your keyword! When your content links change you only need to edit your existing shortlink
	and your clients still are lead to the right target.
	</p>
		
	<a id="component"><h2>Shortlink Component</h2></a>
	<p>
	The Shortlink component is easy to use. You create a shortlink by defining a phrase, then you select an article or enter a URL.
	Optionally you enter a description. That's all!
	The component shows you the resulting shorter link you can give to your clients. Out of the box you may use the
	helper file 'goto.php' which is installed in your Joomla! root on component installation. So your resulting link
	looks like
	</p>
	<pre>http://www.example.com/goto.php?link=keyword</pre>
	<p>
	The example consists of several parts:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>http://www.example.com/ (your homepage URL)</li>
		<li>goto.php (the helper file mentioned above)</li>
		<li>?link= (parameter name)</li>
		<li>keyword (your short keyword)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	Everything is editable in the component configuration (well, only your homepage URL won't be editable ;-) ).
	You may change the filename 'goto.php' and let the component move it to the correct location on your server.
	You may change the parameter name 'link' to an even shorter name like 'l'.
	And you define your keyword for each shortlink. So, a shorter link would look like
	</p>
	<pre>http://www.example.com/g.php?l=keyword</pre>
	<p>
	You won't need anything more, no configuration, no Joomla! core changes, nothing.
	</p>
	<p>
	Shortlink gives you more. You get a little statistic for each shortlink. It helps you to recognize
	popular links and it shows you which links aren't called in the past few weeks. You may set some filter criteria
	to only see the most important links. You may filter your complete collection of shortlinks with a filter box
	to find shortlinks containing your search word in their phrase, description, URL or article title.
