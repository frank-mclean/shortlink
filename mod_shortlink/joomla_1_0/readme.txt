Shortlink - A Mambo Component (tested with v 4.5.1a)

The component lets you define short phrases, that can be used to let users jump to a specific site or article.

Short how-to:

0. install com_shortlink (and optionally the corresponding module mod_shortlink),
   don't forget to move the file 'goto.php' under '/components/com_shortlink' to the root dir of your site!
1. in the backend, define phrases for links (it's intuitive ;-)
2. try it,
   e.g. with a given phrase "gesellix" set to "http://www.gesellix.de/"
        enter "www.your-site.com/goto.php?link=gesellix" into your browser
        and you are directed to the specified location

This module provides you a simple textfield, it lets users enter the phrase and they are redirected, just like having used the method described in 2.

Questions or ideas? Contact me at www.gesellix.de!

The component and its module may be freely distributed. But changes have to be told to me - i'm just curious and eventually, I can learn something from you ;-)

Have fun,
Tobias
